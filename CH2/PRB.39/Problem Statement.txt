The issue is how to take data from an excel sheet and create a program that when searching 
and getting a match for one column, it can provide the related column...

Ex. If I search for the last name, and find a match, it will give me the corresponding 
first name

There are a couple ways I think it can be achieved:

- I think I can make a hash table by reading the data from Excel into my program

- The R programming language has the ability to read in excel files using this 
package:

Figuring out how to port this to C++ could be a good way to deal with excel files in the 
future, but Im not sure how easy this is.

Unit tested the script and input each amino acid element numbers.
Had to adjust the range from 0.75 to 0.1 in order to seperate the amino acids that 
had very close molecular weights.

Also, when the last amino acid from the CSV is printed to console it gets printed twice...
probably due to the CRLF at the end.
