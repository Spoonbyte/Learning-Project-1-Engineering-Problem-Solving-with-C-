FIRST ATTEMPT:
-----------------------
I was curious how using "x" as a global variable would work.
 
It seems to have worked well when I fed the value of "a" into x 
then just incremented from there to plot the function.

FURTHER ATTEMPTS:
-----------------------
Now I just need to understand how the 0/0 point works, since the 
books shows to just set that point to 1....

not sure how sin(0)/0 = 1??? 
Apparently you have to use l'Hopitals Rule?

Also I really don't remember WHY sin(0) = 0 in the first place...

USINIG SCILAB (10/2/24):
--------------------------
I used scilab to plot the outputs but I had to split the data into a "x" file and a "sincx" file.
That's the way it seems the fscanfMat function works, not sure how to do it without splitting the data.
