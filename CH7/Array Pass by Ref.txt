There is a very significant difference in using arrays as parameters, and using simple
objects as parameters. When a simple object is used as a parameter, the default is always a
pass by value. When an array is used as a parameter, it is always a pass by reference. Recall that a pass by reference means that the memory address of the argument, rather than
the value, is passed to the formal parameter. When an array is used as a parameter, the address of the first element is passed to the function. The function uses this address, along with
an integer offset, to reference values in the original array, as illustrated in Figure 7.2 and
Figure 7.3. Any changes made to the array in the function are made directly to the array argument. Because a function accesses the array argument directly, we must be very careful not
to inadvertently change values in an array within a function. Of course, there may be occasions when we wish to change the values in the array, as we will see in later examples in this
chapter.
