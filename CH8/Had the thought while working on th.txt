Had the thought while working on the Sec 8.6 problem that I dont think this is how we would be 
solving a electrical engineer problem with code...I think it would be more of figuring out how 
to solve....ehh never mind...as I was writing this I had the other thought that the point of this 
problem is to MODEL the system of the provided circuit to be able to solve for the currents

it is essentially a circuit simulation problem which can be useful when designing circuits 

But it is not necessarily code that will go be in a product (like uploaded to a processor)
