# Learning-Project-1-Engineering-Problem-Solving-with-C-
This is a compilation of all the code I wrote as I worked through the problems in the book:<br> 
"Engineering Problem Solving with C++" by Delores M. Etter

This project lasted from about March 2024 through about March 2025.

Here is the Table of Contents for all the chapters I worked through:<br>

Chapter 2: Simple C++ Programs<br>
Chapter 3: Control Structures - Selection<br>
Chapter 4: Control Structures - Repetition<br>
Chapter 5: Working with Data Files<br>
Chapter 6: Modular Programming with Functions<br>
Chapter 7: 1-Dimensional Arrays<br>
Chapter 8: 2-Dimensional Arrays<br>
Chapter 9: An Introduction to Pointers<br>

The solutions I have are pretty unorganized and not polished by any means.<br>
There is a lot of playing around and trying things, which was a great way to learn!
